Routing:
The router enables navigation from one view to the next as users perform tasks on application.Here the view that we are referring will be in the form of components.

	Registering a Route:
	In the main parent component app.module.ts, we have to now include the router module as 	shown below âˆ’
  
		import { RouterModule} from '@angular/router';
		@NgModule({
			imports: [
      				BrowserModule,
    				 RouterModule.forRoot([
         					{
          						path: 'new-cmp',     //Name of new component
            					component: NewCmpComponent
         					}
     				 ])
  			 ],
		})
